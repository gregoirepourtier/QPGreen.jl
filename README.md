# Efficient Methods for Computing Quasi-Periodic Green Functions for Helmholtz Equation

Toolbox for computing quasi-periodic Green functions for the Helmholtz equation in an efficient manner.

The proposed method leverages the properties of Fourier series and the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm to efficiently compute the quasi-periodic Green functions. By decomposing the Green function into its Fourier series representation, we can exploit the periodicity of the domain to simplify the computation. The FFT algorithm allows us to efficiently compute the Fourier coefficients and reconstruct the Green function in the spatial domain.
